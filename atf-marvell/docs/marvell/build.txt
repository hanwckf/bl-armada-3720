TF-A Build Instructions
======================

This section describes how to compile the ARM Trusted Firmware (TF-A) project for Marvell's platforms.
The are 2 methods to compile u-boot:

1. Using prepared scripts

2. Manual compilation

Both methods will be described in this document.

System preparations (for both methods)
--------------------------------------
(1) Set the cross compiler::

		> export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/toolchain/aarch64-linux-gnu-

(2) Set path for MV_DDR component::

		> export MV_DDR_PATH=path/to/mv_ddr

	For A7/8K, use this parameter to point to mv_ddr driver sources to allow BLE build.
	For A37x0, it is used for ddr_tool build.

	Usage example: MV_DDR_PATH=path/to/mv_ddr

	The parameter is optional for A7/8K, when this parameter is not set, the mv_ddr
	sources are expected to be located at: drivers/marvell/mv_ddr. However, the parameter
	is necessary for A37x0.

(3) Set path for FIP images:

	Set U-Boot image path (relatively to TF-A root or absolute path)::

		> export BL33=path/to/u-boot.bin

	For example: if U-Boot project (and its images) is located at ~/project/u-boot,
	BL33 should be ~/project/u-boot/u-boot.bin

	.. note::

	   u-boot.bin should be used and not u-boot-spl.bin

	Set MSS/SCP image path (mandatory only for Armada80x0 and Aramada8xxy)::

		> export SCP_BL2=path/to/mrvl_scp_bl2*.img

(4) Armada-37x0 build requires WTP tools installation.

	See below in the section "Tools Installation for Armada37x0 Builds".
	Install ARM 32-bit cross compiler, which is required by building WTMI image for CM3::

		> sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi

Build with scripts
------------------
The script is located in the u-boot tree **./scripts/ci/**

Script usage::

		> ./scripts/ci/compile.sh --help

		Usage: compile [--no_configure] [--echo_only] BUILD_NAME
		 or:   compile --list
		 or:   compile --help

		Compiles atf similar to the given CI build

		-N, --no_configure   Skip configuration steps (make distclean)
 		-e, --echo_only      Print out the compilation sequence but do not execute it
		 -l, --list           List all supported BUILD_NAME values and exit
		 -h, --help           Display this help and exit

		Prerequisites:
		  CROSS_COMPILE       path to cross compiler
		  BL33                path to u-boot or uefi binary
		  MV_DDR_PATH         path to ddr source
		  SCP_BL2             path to FreeRTOS binary (optional)
		  WTMI_IMG            path to FreeRTOS binary for armada-3700 (optional)
		  WTP                 path to a3700 utils source (optional)

Examples::

		MacchiatoBin build: ./scripts/ci/compile.sh uboot_2018_a80x0_mcbin

Manual build procedure
----------------------
(1) Clean previous build residuals (if any)::

		> make distclean

(2) Build TF-A:

	There are several build options:

	- WORKAROUND_CVE_2018_3639: Enable/Disable CVE-2018-3639 workaround. Starting TF-A release
	  18.09 the default value is "0" (disabled).

	- DEBUG: default is without debug information (=0). in order to enable it use DEBUG=1

	- LOG_LEVEL: defines the level of logging which will be purged to the default output port.

		LOG_LEVEL_NONE		0
		LOG_LEVEL_ERROR		10
		LOG_LEVEL_NOTICE	20
		LOG_LEVEL_WARNING	30
		LOG_LEVEL_INFO		40
		LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE	50

	- USE_COHERENT_MEM: This flag determines whether to include the coherent memory region in the
		BL memory map or not.

	- LLC_ENABLE: Flag defining the LLC (L3) cache state. The cache is enabled by default (LLC_ENABLE=1).

	- MARVELL_SECURE_BOOT: build trusted(=1)/non trusted(=0) image, default is non trusted.

	- BLE_PATH:
		Points to BLE (Binary ROM extension) sources folder. Only required for A8K and A8K+ builds.
		The parameter is optional, its default value is "ble".

	- DDR_TOPOLOGY: For Armada37x0 only, the DDR topology map index/name, default is 0.
		Supported Options:
			- DDR3 1CS (0): DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular (512MB); EspressoBIN (512MB)
			- DDR4 1CS (1): DB-88F3720-DDR4-Modular (512MB)
			- DDR3 2CS (2): EspressoBIN V3-V5 (1GB)
			- DDR4 2CS (3): DB-88F3720-DDR4-Modular (4GB)
			- DDR3 1CS (4): DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular (1GB)
			- DDR4 1CS (5): EspressoBin V7 (1GB)
			- DDR4 2CS (6): EspressoBin V7 (2GB)
			- CUSTOMER (CUST): Customer board, DDR3 1CS 512MB

	- CLOCKSPRESET: For Armada37x0 only, the clock tree configuration preset including CPU and DDR frequency,
		default is CPU_800_DDR_800.
			- CPU_600_DDR_600	-	CPU at 600 MHz, DDR at 600 MHz
			- CPU_800_DDR_800	-	CPU at 800 MHz, DDR at 800 MHz
			- CPU_1000_DDR_800	-	CPU at 1000 MHz, DDR at 800 MHz
			- CPU_1200_DDR_750	-	CPU at 1200 MHz, DDR at 750 MHz

	- BOOTDEV: For Armada37x0 only, the flash boot device, default is SPINOR,
			Currently, Armada37x0 only supports SPINOR, SPINAND, EMMCNORM and SATA:

				- SPINOR - SPI NOR flash boot
				- SPINAND - SPI NAND flash boot
				- EMMCNORM - eMMC Download Mode
					Download boot loader or program code from eMMC flash into CM3 or CA53
					Requires full initialization and command sequence
				- SATA - SATA device boot

	- PARTNUM: For Armada37x0 only, the boot partition number, default is 0. To boot from eMMC, the value
		should be aligned with the parameter in U-Boot with name of CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_PART, whose
		value by default is 1.
		For details about CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_PART, please refer to the U-Boot build instructions.

	- WTMI_IMG: For Armada37x0 only, the path of the WTMI image can point to an image which does
		nothing, an image which supports EFUSE or a customized CM3 firmware binary. The default image
		is wtmi.bin that built from sources in WTP folder, which is the next option. If the default
		image is OK, then this option should be skipped.
	- WTP: For Armada37x0 only, use this parameter to point to wtptools source code directory, which
		can be found as a3700_utils.zip in the release.
		Usage example: WTP=/path/to/a3700_utils

	- CP_NUM: Total amount of CPs (South Bridge) chips wired to the interconnected APs.
		When the parameter is omitted, the build is uses the default number of CPs equal to 2.
		The parameter is valid for Armada 8K-plus SoC family (PLAT=a8xxy) and results in a build of images
		suitable for a8xxY SoC, where "Y" is a number of connected CPs and "xx" is a number of CPU cores.
		Valid values with CP_NUM is in a range of 0 to 8.
		The CPs defined by this parameter are evenly distributed across interconnected APs that in turn
		are dynamically detected. For instance, if the CP_NUM=6 and the TF-A detects 2 interconnected
		APs, each AP assumed to have 3 attached CPs. With the same amount of APs and CP_NUM=3, the AP0
		will have 2 CPs connected and AP1 - a just single CP.

	- ARO_ENABLE: configure CPU frequency using ARO clock driver (instead of PLL clock driver).

	For example, in order to build the image in debug mode with log level up to 'notice' level run::

		> make DEBUG=1 USE_COHERENT_MEM=0 LOG_LEVEL=20 PLAT=<MARVELL_PLATFORM> all fip

	And if we want to build a Armada37x0 image in debug mode with log level up to 'notice' level,
	the image has the preset CPU at 1000 MHz, preset DDR3 at 800 MHz, the DDR topology of DDR3 2CS,
	the image boot from SPI NOR flash partition 0, and the image is non trusted in WTP, the command
	line is as following::

		> make DEBUG=1 USE_COHERENT_MEM=0 LOG_LEVEL=20 SECURE=0 CLOCKSPRESET=CPU_1000_DDR_800 \
			DDR_TOPOLOGY=2 BOOTDEV=SPINOR PARTNUM=0 PLAT=a3700 all fip

	Supported MARVELL_PLATFORM are:
		- a3700
		- a70x0
		- a70x0_amc (for AMC board)
		- a70x0_cust (for customers)
		- a80x0
		- a80x0_mcbin (for MacciatoBin)
		- a8xxy

Special Build Flags
--------------------
	- PALLADIUM: Enables building TF-A for palladium target. This mainly involves changing the UART baud rate
		and the timer frequency to a lower values to match palladium's setup.
	- PLAT_RECOVERY_IMAGE_ENABLE: When set this option to enable secondary recovery function when build
		atf. In order to build uart recovery image this operation should be disabled for a70x0 and a80x0
                because of hardware limitation(boot from secondary image can interrupt uart recovery process).
		This MACRO definition is set in plat/marvell/a8k/common/include/platform_def.h file

(for more information about build options, please refer to section 'Summary of build options' in  TF-A user-guide:
 https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md)


Build output
-------------
Marvell's TF-A compilation generates 7 files:
	- ble.bin		- BLe image
	- bl1.bin		- BL1 image
	- bl2.bin		- BL2 image
	- bl31.bin		- BL31 image
	- fip.bin		- FIP image (contains BL2, BL31 & BL33 (U-Boot) images)
	- boot-image.bin	- TF-A image (contains BL1 and FIP images)
	- flash-image.bin	- Image which contains boot-image.bin and SPL image; should be placed on the boot flash/device.


Tools Installation for Armada37x0 Builds
-----------------------------------------
Install a cross GNU ARM tool chain for building the WTMI binary.
Any cross GNU ARM tool chain that is able to build ARM Cortex M3 binaries
is suitable.

On Debian/Uboot hosts the default GNU ARM tool chain can be installed
using the following command::

		> sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi

If required, the default tool chain prefix "arm-linux-gnueabi-" can be
overwritten using the environment variable CROSS_CM3.
Example for BASH shell::

		> export CROSS_CM3=/opt/arm-cross/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi
